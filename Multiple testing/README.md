This folder contains the R code for reproducing the results in the paper "Multiple testing with anytime-valid Monte-Carlo p-values" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07365). In the aforementioned paper, we showed how anytime-valid Monte-Carlo p-values can be used to adapt the number of permutations to the number of rejections when multiple testing procedures are applied to potentially save computational effort.
