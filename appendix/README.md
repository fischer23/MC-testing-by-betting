This folder contains the R code for the additional simulations provided in the appendix of the paper "Sequential Monte-Carlo testing by betting"

Files:

appendix_generate_data_power.R: Generates the results for the simulations of the Figures S.3-S.9 and saves them in the results folder.

appendix_generate_data_pval.R: Generates the results for the simulations of the Figures S.1-S.2 and saves them in the results folder.

appendix_plot_generator.R: Uses the data generated by appendix_generate_data_power.R and appendix_generate_data_pval.R to generate Figures S.1-S.9 of the paper.
